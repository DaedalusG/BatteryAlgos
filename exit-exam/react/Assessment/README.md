Instructions:

For this assessment you will demonstrate you knowledge of React by completing a simple calculator application.

The framework for this app has been provided for you as well. You will not need to contribute any custom css or styling. 
- You may choose to build out EITHER the class component framework `CalcClass` or functional component framework utilizing hooks `CalcHook`
- Comment in ONLY the `export default` at the bottom of the page that corresponds to your chosen approach. Leaving both commented or uncommented simultaneously will result in a failed test.

Refer to the pdf mockup for the completed app.

- All code should be written in `./src/components/Calculator.js`
- When not displaying a number `input` and `display` values should be an empty string `''`
- `+` should be the default opperator.
- If `Calculate` is attempted without 2 number inputs, `Select Two Numbers` should be rendered as an error message.
